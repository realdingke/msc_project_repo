## Instructions for running the program

### Part 1 Instructions
The provided main function can be run using the following command

`python3 part1_nn_lib.py`

### Part 2 Instructions
The program can be run using the following command

`python3 part2_house_value_regression.py`

This will run the code within `example_main()` which is by default setup to train a `[512, 512, 128]` model with an early stopping `patience`
value of 8 and `nn.ReLU()` activation functions for each layer.
